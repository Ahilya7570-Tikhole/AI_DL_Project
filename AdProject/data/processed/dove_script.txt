**Advertisement Script: Dove - Unfold Your True Glow**

**(Music: Gentle, uplifting instrumental track begins and continues softly throughout)**

**Scene 1:**
A young woman (mid-20s, diverse ethnicity) looks at her reflection in a steamy bathroom mirror after a shower. She gently touches her face, a hint of thoughtfulness or quiet introspection on her face. Her skin looks soft and fresh.

**Voiceover (English):**
In a world constantly telling you who to be, there's a quiet strength in simply being yourself.

**Voiceover (Hindi):**
Ek aisi duniya mein jahan har koi aapko batata hai ki aapko kaisa hona chahiye, apne aap mein rehne ki ek alag hi shakti hai.

**Scene 2:**
A mother (40s, diverse ethnicity) gently washes her face with a Dove Beauty Bar, the rich, creamy lather looking indulgent. She smiles softly, feeling refreshed and cared for. Cut to a quick shot of a teenage girl (16-17) confidently presenting an idea in a classroom, her skin looking naturally healthy.

**Voiceover (English):**
It starts with kindness. Kindness to your skin, kindness to your spirit.
Dove believes in the beauty that unfolds when you nourish yourself, inside and out.

**Voiceover (Hindi):**
Yeh shuruaat hoti hai daya se. Apni twacha ke prati daya, apni aatma ke prati daya.
Dove vishwas karta hai us khoobsurti mein jo tab khilti hai, jab aap khud ko andar aur bahar se poshan dete hain.

**Text on Screen:**
Kindness Starts Here.

**Scene 3:**
A diverse montage:
- A man (30s) confidently walking into a meeting, a subtle, genuine smile on his face.
- A woman (60s) laughing heartily with friends in a sunny park, her eyes sparkling with joy.
- A young girl (8-10) proudly showing off her vibrant drawing to her parent, her face beaming with self-assurance.
- A final, elegant shot of various Dove products (beauty bar, body wash, lotion) arranged beautifully on a clean bathroom counter, subtly catching the light.

**Voiceover (English):**
Feel the gentle care. Embrace the confidence that blooms from within.
Because true beauty isn't about perfection; it's about the unique, radiant you.
Unfold your true glow. With Dove.

**Voiceover (Hindi):**
Mehsoos karein yeh komal dekhbhal. Us aatma-vishwas ko apnayein jo andar se khilta hai.
Kyonki asli khoobsurti purnata ke baare mein nahi hai; yeh aapke anokhe, chamakdar vyaktitva ke baare mein hai.
Apni sacchi chamak ko khulne do. Dove ke saath.

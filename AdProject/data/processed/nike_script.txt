**(Advertisement Begins)**

**Scene 1:**
*   **Visuals:** Early morning mist hangs over a quiet, tree-lined path. A diverse young woman (20s-30s) in Nike running gear takes a deep breath, eyes focused but with a hint of uncertainty. She laces up her Nike running shoes, then begins a slow, deliberate jog. The camera subtly highlights her footwear.

**Voiceover (English):** Every journey begins with a single step. Or a decision. The quiet whisper that says, 'I can try.'

**Voiceover (Hindi):** हर सफर एक कदम से शुरू होता है। या एक फैसले से। वह शांत फुसफुसाहट जो कहती है, 'मैं कोशिश कर सकता हूँ।'

**Scene 2:**
*   **Visuals:** Quick cuts between different scenarios, showcasing effort and determination:
    *   The same woman, now pushing herself up a steep incline, face showing strain but also resolve. Sweat glistens.
    *   A young man (20s-30s, diverse ethnicity) in a home studio, intensely focused, sketching on a digital tablet, surrounded by creative tools. He's wearing Nike tech fleece and sneakers. He erases, reworks, pushes harder.
    *   A middle-aged person (40s-50s, diverse ethnicity) in a bustling community kitchen, meticulously preparing food, moving with purpose and passion. They're wearing comfortable Nike trainers.
*   **Text on Screen:** The Effort. The Journey. The Reward.

**Voiceover (English):** It’s in the grind. The late nights. The early mornings. The moments you doubt, then push through. It’s not just about winning; it’s about the will to keep going.

**Voiceover (Hindi):** यह मेहनत में है। देर रात तक। सुबह जल्दी। वे पल जब आप संदेह करते हैं, फिर भी आगे बढ़ते हैं। यह सिर्फ जीतने के बारे में नहीं है; यह आगे बढ़ते रहने की इच्छाशक्ति के बारे में है।

**Scene 3:**
*   **Visuals:**
    *   The woman from Scene 1, now at the top of a scenic hill, overlooking a vibrant sunrise, arms outstretched, a look of pure accomplishment and joy.
    *   The young man from Scene 2, proudly presenting his completed digital artwork on a large screen, receiving enthusiastic applause.
    *   The middle-aged person from Scene 2, serving a delicious meal to smiling, appreciative community members.
    *   Quick cuts to various people of all ages and backgrounds (a child learning to ride a bike, an elderly couple walking in a park, a team celebrating a small victory) wearing Nike, all with expressions of joy, determination, or achievement. A universal feeling of personal triumph.
*   **Text on Screen:** NIKE. Just Do It.
*   **Final Text on Screen:** Nike.com (with the Nike Swoosh logo)

**Voiceover (English):** Because greatness isn't just on a podium. It's in every step you take towards who you want to be. In every challenge you face, every dream you chase. It's in you.

**Voiceover (Hindi):** क्योंकि महानता सिर्फ पोडियम पर नहीं होती। यह आपके हर उस कदम में है जो आप अपने लक्ष्य की ओर बढ़ाते हैं। हर चुनौती में जिसका आप सामना करते हैं, हर सपने में जिसका आप पीछा करते हैं। यह आपके अंदर है।

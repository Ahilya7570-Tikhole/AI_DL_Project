**Advertisement Script:**

**(Scene 1: 0-10 seconds)**
**Visuals:**
*   **Scene 1:** A young female artist stares blankly at a canvas, a half-drawn sketch frustratingly incomplete. She sighs, running a hand through her hair. A male dancer in a studio struggles with a difficult pirouette, stumbling slightly, looking a bit dejected. A young professional looks thoughtfully at a complex spreadsheet on her laptop, a slight furrow in her brow, amidst scattered notes. The mood is one of thoughtful contemplation, a minor block or moment of hesitation.

**Voiceover (English):** "Sometimes, life asks a little more. A moment of doubt, a creative block, a challenge that feels just out of reach."
**Voiceover (Hindi):** "Kabhi kabhi, zindagi humse thoda aur maangti hai. Woh pal jab thodi shanka ho, ya koi naya khayal na aaye, ya chunauti mushkil lage."

**(Scene 2: 11-20 seconds)**
**Visuals:**
*   **Scene 2:** Close-up on the artist's hand reaching for a chilled Pepsi bottle next to her easel. She unscrews the cap with a satisfying pop and takes a long, refreshing sip, eyes closing for a moment, then opening with a renewed glint. The dancer pauses, grabs a Pepsi can from his bag, the fizz sound prominent, and takes a deep, satisfying drink, a smile starting to form as he feels the invigoration. The professional opens a Pepsi can, takes a refreshing gulp, a flicker of an idea sparking in her eyes as she looks back at her screen.

**Voiceover (English):** "But what if all you needed was a spark? A burst of crisp, refreshing energy to clear your mind, to find your rhythm, to just… go for it."
**Voiceover (Hindi):** "Par kya ho agar aapko bas ek chingaari chahiye? Ek taazgi bhari urja ka jhonka jo aapka mann saaf kare, aapki taal dhoondhe, aur bas... shuru kar de."

**(Scene 3: 21-28 seconds)**
**Visuals:**
*   **Scene 3:** The artist, energized, confidently splashes vibrant colors onto her canvas, her masterpiece taking shape with bold strokes. The dancer, with new vigor, nails the difficult pirouette, landing perfectly with a triumphant flourish, a wide smile of accomplishment. The professional, with a confident smile, types rapidly, solving the problem on her spreadsheet, then closes her laptop with a look of pure achievement. Quick cuts of these individuals owning their moments.

**Text on Screen (During Scene 3):** Unleash Your Potential.

**Voiceover (English):** "That feeling when everything clicks. The confidence to create, the power to perform, the clarity to conquer. It’s inside you, waiting to be unleashed."
**Voiceover (Hindi):** "Woh ehsaas jab sab kuch jud jaye. Banane ki himmat, perform karne ki taaqat, mushkilon ko jeetne ki spashtta. Yeh sab aapke andar hai, bas bahar aane ka intezaar kar raha hai."

**(Final Scene / Product Shot: 29-30 seconds)**
**Visuals:**
*   A dynamic, close-up shot of a condensation-covered Pepsi can and bottle. It spins slightly, reflecting light.
*   The shot then holds on a clean, well-lit product display with the Pepsi logo prominently featured.
